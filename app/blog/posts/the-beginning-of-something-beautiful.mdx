A couple of weeks ago, I decided to seriously explore an idea that’s been lingering in the back of my mind: opening a teahouse. It all started a few months ago when I visited **Tea at Shiloh** in downtown LA. The space was breathtaking—calm, intentional, and full of energy that made you want to stay and savor every moment.

I remember thinking, _Why isn’t there a place like this in Austin?_ The vibe, the aesthetic—everything about it screamed Austin to me. My friend who introduced me to the space even suggested reaching out to Tea at Shiloh about a potential franchising opportunity.

For months, I waited to act on this idea. The reason? **My visa situation.** As an international student-turned-professional, I’ve spent years navigating the constraints of staying in the U.S. After graduating, I relied on my OPT, which is set to expire on **June 30, 2025**. I didn’t get an H-1B visa, and for a long time, I honestly didn’t know if I would even be able to stay in the U.S. much longer. My career decisions were driven more by practicality than passion.

When I chose marketing for my master’s degree, it wasn’t because I loved it—it was the next logical step from my film background, and it granted me a STEM degree that extended my visa eligibility. To secure my future, I pivoted to data science, spending countless hours studying and upskilling. Eventually, I landed a role as a **marketing data scientist**—a title I was proud of at the time.

I thought having a “cool” job at a “cool” company would make me feel accomplished, even fulfilled. And for a while, it did. I loved telling people what I did and basked in the recognition it brought. But as time went on, that sense of pride wore off.

Two years into the job, I realized I wasn’t happy. The constant changes at the company, the lack of growth opportunities, and most importantly, my own disinterest in the work left me feeling empty. I blame myself, too—I never advocated for more because, deep down, I didn’t care about the work.

For so long, I felt stuck in this cycle: _I don’t like my job; I want a new job._ But every time I considered making a change, my negative thoughts would hold me back: _I’m not good enough. I’ll fail the coding exams. I’m a fake data scientist._ These doubts kept me paralyzed, and I stayed where I was, too unmotivated to push myself toward something new.

In search of meaning, I poured myself into hobbies: **triathlon training, freediving, traveling, music festivals,** and more. But no matter how much joy these brought, they couldn’t fill the void of spending eight hours a day doing something that felt meaningless. I didn’t want to dedicate my time to helping a corporation make more money, especially when it didn’t align with my values.

Then came **December 2024**, and everything changed. My parents decided to support me in applying for an **EB-5 investment visa**, a move that would give me the freedom to work in the U.S. on my terms. For the first time in years, I wasn’t bound by a job for survival. I could finally do something that speaks true to me.

That’s when I realized: **this is my chance.** The teahouse idea that had been quietly waiting in the back of my mind suddenly felt possible. I could create something beautiful, just like Tea at Shiloh, but make it my own. Something that brings people together, fosters a sense of peace, and fills the void I’ve felt for so long.

And so, here I am, documenting the beginning of this journey. I don’t know where it will lead or what obstacles I’ll face, but I know one thing: it’s time to take a leap of faith, step out of my comfort zone, and create something meaningful.
