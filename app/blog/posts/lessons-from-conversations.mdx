A couple of weeks ago, I reached out to **Tea at Shiloh**, and to my surprise, one of the owners kindly agreed to speak with me. We talked for over an hour, and they shared so much valuable advice about starting a teahouse. I was incredibly grateful that they took the time to help me.

After that conversation, I started planning my timeline and drafting a business plan with estimated costs. Admittedly, everything felt fuzzy—I had no clear idea how much it would actually cost. But I did my best to research. I looked up the costs of licenses, rent for a space, utilities, and everything else I could think of. I also reached out to **Chinese designers** to explore more affordable design services and materials, and even furniture from China.

I connected with a modern Chinese tea company that specializes in branding and sourcing for contemporary tea shops. They provided insight into resources and supply chains, which helped me start piecing things together. However, **funding quickly emerged as my biggest obstacle.** I learned that SBA loans require at least two years of business experience, which I don’t have. That leaves me relying on my personal savings and possibly investments from friends.

Even with those options, raising $200,000—or more—felt like an impossible goal. When I spoke with the owner at Tea at Shiloh again, they told me that with such limited funding, I’d need a lot of help from others. That hit a nerve. Growing up, I’ve always preferred to do things on my own. I’ve struggled to trust others to handle things better than I could. In college group projects, for instance, I would often take charge and do everything myself. The idea of relying on people and networking makes me deeply uncomfortable. It also brought out a deeper insecurity I’ve carried for years—**my fear of rejection and the uncertainty of connecting with new people.**

But through these conversations, I’ve realized something profound: **business owners are magnets for resources and connections.** Entrepreneurship will be an incredible opportunity for me to grow into the person I’ve always wanted to be—a version of myself that is courageous, authentic, and open.

That conversation also revealed a hard truth: I can’t just throw money at a space and expect people to show up. The Tea at Shiloh team did a ton of groundwork before they even opened. They had trial runs, built anticipation, and created a community around their brand. When they launched, it wasn’t just a teahouse opening—it was something that people had been waiting for. I don’t have that kind of community or those marketing skills, and the reality of that left me feeling crushed.

For a moment, I felt like my dreams were shattered. I kept thinking:

> _I have no talent. I have no money. What am I even good at?_

If there’s one thing I can confidently say I’m good at, it’s **organizing and planning.** My mind immediately starts thinking of all the details: what equipment is needed, what steps need to happen, and how to keep everything on track.

My boyfriend reminded me of something I’d once said:

> _Do you know who goes on stage to accept the Oscar when a film wins Best Picture? The producer. The behind-the-scenes person no one hears about._

Maybe that’s the role I’m meant to play—the producer who brings the vision to life. But to do that, I might need to find my “director,” someone who can create the energy and excitement I want for the space.

The next day, I had a meeting with the owner of **Aurora House**, an arts and crafts space focused on female empowerment. They’ve already achieved incredible success, and I was lucky that she scheduled time to talk with me. During our meeting, I learned that she didn’t spend half a million dollars to start her business. In fact, her current space is just a trial run for a much bigger vision. Her journey, from tech to running a creative space with a powerful mission, left me feeling deeply inspired. She showed me that you don’t need a fortune to get started. Sometimes, you just need a clear vision, determination, and a bit of help along the way.

So far, everyone I’ve spoken with has been incredibly supportive, and I’m so grateful for the connections I’m making. I’ve realized that I need to take a leap of faith and make the changes I want to see in my life. As they say, _nothing changes if nothing changes._

Right now, I’m focusing on **meeting people and learning from them.** I’ve started reaching out to business owners, wellness event organizers, and anyone else who can share their experience. Next week, I’m hosting my first **tea social**—a cozy gathering in my apartment with tea and s’mores. We’ll see how it goes.

**Until next time…**
