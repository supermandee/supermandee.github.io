In my last journal, I talked about the *project that energized me at work.* I found an opportunity to automate a tedious process, jumped on it, and built something I thought would be valuable for our teams. I felt **invincible**—using AI-generated code, I built the core functionality in just eight hours and immediately shared it on Medium and LinkedIn. At the time, I believed it had **real** potential, and I couldn’t wait to show everyone.  

The **excitement** I felt was *physical*—an urge expanding like a spider web, ready to reach others.

Eventually, I presented it to my coworkers and one of our directors. One coworker—who leads a major project where my app could play a part—told me *it wasn’t the right moment* to involve another team. That response threw me off. *Why was someone at my level deciding what I could or couldn’t do?* 

The next day, I showed it to her again, this time with a coworker who was one level up. They both agreed it was worth sharing with the leaders managing the larger project.

I also messaged my director, sent him a screenshot of the app, and asked how I could contribute more. **No response.** Self-doubt crept in. *What if it’s not as valuable as I thought?* But I knew it was—this automation would prevent the burnout that caused two people to quit the last time they did this project manually. 

Later, I found out that while he didn’t respond, he did screenshot my message and share it in the managers’ group chat, calling me a **“go-getter.”** That brought some relief.

Soon after, I scheduled a meeting with another director. She was excited about the product, but when I mentioned wanting to take the lead on it, she quickly shifted the conversation. She said they needed to evaluate *who should own it* because another manager wanted to build a similar tool in Tableau. 

The next day, she brought it up in a team meeting, emphasizing that the decision should be based on **roles and responsibilities,** not just personal interest.

I couldn’t help but feel like that was directed at me. I had taken the initiative to build something useful, and now corporate bureaucracy was slowing everything down. *Maybe I ruffled some feathers by bypassing layers of structure. Maybe I wasn’t supposed to move this quickly.* 

Suddenly, all that initial energy I had—the **spider-web-like expansion**—felt trapped inside me, unable to go anywhere.

## The Bus Driver and the Passengers

I talked to my therapist about it. His response? 

*Forget everyone else. You saw an opportunity, took action, and made something happen. That’s success in itself.*

Then he said something that changed my perspective entirely:

> *“You’re overidentifying with this part of yourself.”*

At first, I didn’t understand what that meant. He then told me to imagine myself as a **bus driver**, with different versions of me as passengers. 

There’s *Jealous Me*, *Coder Me*, *Entrepreneur Me*, *Problem-Solving Me*, *Creative Me*—all sitting in the back. The issue is, when one version hijacks the wheel, I become *only* that person. Right now, *Employee Me*—the one who wants to create value and gain validation from coworkers and managers—was taking over the bus.

I realized he was right. I was so proud of what I’d built, and the first sign of resistance made me spiral. My emotions were magnified by how closely I tied my identity to this single project. I assumed my coworkers and bosses didn’t value my work when, in reality, **I had no clue what they were thinking.**

I remembered that when I started my entrepreneurial journey, I had the same emotional swings—feeling **unstoppable** when things went well and like a **failure** when they didn’t. That’s because back then, *Entrepreneur Me* was driving the bus. But **I am more than just the work I do.**

*What am I, then?* I don’t know. I’m still discovering.

We also talked about my desire for validation—especially from my director, who has always felt intimidating. I wanted him to see me as someone valuable and important. He hired me, and I would not want him to ever feel disappointed. As my therapist explained this, I cried and giggled at the same time. I didn’t even fully understand why I was crying—it just felt like something inside me finally clicked. 

I told him I *felt sorry for myself* for constantly seeking external validation, for caring so much about whether my boss approved of me—which I *shouldn’t* have.

He paused and then gave me a gift:

*“Stop saying ‘should’ or ‘shouldn’t.’ That’s just self-shaming. Instead, acknowledge what you’d like to change, without blaming yourself for where you are now. You’re human. You mess up sometimes. No use in shaming yourself.”*

He pointed out that saying *“I shouldn’t care so much about my boss’s opinion”* is a form of control we learn as children. A healthier approach would be:

> *“I would like to be less affected by other people’s validation.”*

Then he reminded me: **I am worthy as I am.**

My value isn’t just in my work—it’s in my **kindness**, my **ability to share**, my **intentions**. It’s in the spaces I create, like my **Love Letter Tea Social**, where I helped foster an environment of warmth and expression. 

**My worth isn’t measured by a promotion, a title, or an approval from a boss.**

It’s measured by the value I bring to the world in *all* its forms.

## Rewriting My Script

He told me that much of this comes from **cultural conditioning**—the way I was raised, past experiences, and learned behaviors. In Eastern cultures, *performance is often directly tied to identity and worth.* For most of my life, I internalized that belief. My success, my productivity, my ability to impress authority figures—these became measures of my value.

But **I don’t have to keep following that script.**

I can *rewrite* it.

Not by throwing the whole book out the window, but by making **small, intentional changes**—choosing what truly matters to me and defining success on my own terms.

## The More Acceptance I Find in Myself…

By the end of our session, I felt **relieved. Understood.** I left with a deeper awareness of *why* I react the way I do and how I can start changing it.

A few hours later, my therapist sent me a message:

> **“The more acceptance you find in yourself, the less you will seek in others.”**

And that’s where I’ll start.
