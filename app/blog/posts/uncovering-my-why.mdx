Last year, I considered moving from data science to product management. I wasn’t driven by a deep-seated desire to change roles—our team was building more products, and my manager supported the transition. My motivation was driven by the **momentum** around me, not by an intrinsic passion for the title of "product manager."

However, a recent conversation with a coworker made me rethink my career. While many view corporate life as a *soul-sucking 9-to-5*, my experience has been more nuanced. Yes, I’ve faced office politics and tasks that sometimes feel meaningless, but I’ve also enjoyed the flexibility to work on projects that excite me.

After a reorganization left me feeling lost, I discovered a project that changed my perspective. Noticing teams wasting countless hours on manual Excel and PowerPoint tasks, I built an MVP in under eight hours using AI—a fully automated React app that streamlined these processes.

That project did more than eliminate repetitive work; it reignited my passion for *problem-solving*. With data critical to our brands and colleagues leaving out of frustration, I realized my tool could deliver **genuine business value**.

Learning React with AI as my coding partner sparked *a burst of energy and creativity*. It reminded me of a previous personal project where I combined the Spotify API with OpenAI—a project that revealed my potential and showed me that I was ready to build something great when the opportunity knocked.

Ultimately, what drives me is the desire to create **meaningful impact**—whether that’s through a product, an automation tool, or a machine learning model. The concept of "product" is just one format among many. What truly matters to me is the opportunity to **build, innovate, and deliver value**. If I end up in a product management role, that’s a bonus, but the title itself is secondary to the impact I can create.

Reflecting on these experiences, I see that my entrepreneurial ambitions aren’t a rejection of corporate life. In fact, I’ve been fortunate to work in an environment that values *autonomy and creativity*, and exploring valuable ideas continues to fuel my passion.

So why start a startup? For me, it’s about healing from past setbacks, forming genuine connections with people, and proving to myself that I can take full ownership of something truly meaningful. Today, I’m opening my eyes—and my heart—to new opportunities, embracing this period of change, and committing to a journey where the real measure of success is the value I create along the way.
