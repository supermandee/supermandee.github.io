      <p>
        For years, I stayed in my comfort zone, following the path society laid out for me. With the support of my family and a stable career, I’ve lived a comfortable life. Yet, the corporate world doesn't seem to be aligned with my values or passions. <br /><br />
        Now, I’m stepping away from the familiar to pursue a more meaningful path: building something of my own. This journal is my space to share the raw, unfiltered journey—challenges, lessons, and breakthroughs—as I navigate entrepreneurship and personal growth.<br /><br />
        If you’re here, maybe you’re looking for a little inspiration, the courage to follow your dreams, or simply a reminder that it’s okay to start from where you are. Wherever you’re coming from, I’m grateful you’re here.<br /><br />
        <strong>Welcome to my startup story.</strong>
