          <title>Beyond the 9-to-5: Uncovering My Deeper Why</title>
          <link>https://couchtostartup.com//blog/uncovering-my-why</link>
          <description>Last year, I considered moving from data science to product management. I wasn’t driven by a deep-seated desire to change roles—our team was building more products, and my manager supported the transition. My motivation was driven by the **momentum** around me, not by an intrinsic passion for the title of "product manager."</description>

          <title>Starting Therapy Again</title>
          <link>https://couchtostartup.com//blog/starting-therapy-again</link>
          <description>So, I started therapy again. In 2023, I had five therapy sessions through my company’s benefits. When I first reached out, I was in a rough place, but by the time I finished my last session, I felt much better and thought I didn’t need therapy anymore. Now, I realize it doesn’t matter how I feel—therapy is a space for me to process my emotions and thoughts.</description>

          <title>I Don’t Hate People—I Love People</title>
          <link>https://couchtostartup.com//blog/i-love-people</link>
          <description>Earlier last year, I had a revelation about my social life. For the longest time, I thought I was anti-social, but I now realize that was just a protection mechanism. Deep down, I crave connection and community.</description>

          <title>Yes, I Finally Had an Emotional Outburst</title>
          <link>https://couchtostartup.com//blog/yes-i-had-an-emotional-outburst</link>
          <description>A few days ago, I found a listing for a two-story live/work apartment that seemed perfect for my teahouse idea. The first floor could be used as the teahouse, while the second floor would serve as a living space. It felt like an ideal solution—one rent instead of two. My boyfriend was excited about it too, so we visited the space together.</description>

          <title>My First Tea Social</title>
          <link>https://couchtostartup.com//blog/my-first-tea-social</link>
          <description>On Thursday, I hosted my very first tea social—an idea that sparked just two weeks ago. I’m so glad that most of the people I invited early on showed up, and I took the time to prepare my living room to make it feel special. I added couch covers, blankets, cushions, and even created a cozy little space for my roommate's cat with a sunset lamp, a disco ball, and a small carpet. Since it was a s’mores night, I also bought a tabletop fire, while my boyfriend got meditation cushions, incense, and a beautiful light to set the mood.</description>

          <title>Presence, Love, and Connection</title>
          <link>https://couchtostartup.com//blog/presence-love-connection</link>
          <description>On Tuesday, I had the pleasure of visiting one of the co-owners of West China Tea House. He welcomed me into his home tea space, which was beautifully set up and radiated warmth. Over tea, he shared his personal journey and stories about sourcing tea in China. He asked me an important question: *What is the ethos of your teahouse?*</description>

          <title>Momentum at -3°C: My First Half Marathon</title>
          <link>https://couchtostartup.com//blog/momentum-consistency</link>
          <description>On January 19th, I finished my first half marathon. It was an unforgettable day—a frigid -3°C (that felt like -11°C with the wind), but I woke up feeling good, dressed up, and ready to go. The race was point-to-point, so we drove to the start line without much of a plan for how we’d get back later. Typical.</description>

          <title>Lessons from Conversations</title>
          <link>https://couchtostartup.com//blog/lessons-from-conversations</link>
          <description>A couple of weeks ago, I reached out to Tea at Shiloh, and to my surprise, one of the owners kindly agreed to speak with me. We talked for over an hour, and they shared so much valuable advice about starting a teahouse. I was incredibly grateful that they took the time to help me.</description>

          <title>The Beginning of Something Beautiful</title>
          <link>https://couchtostartup.com//blog/the-beginning-of-something-beautiful</link>
          <description>A couple of weeks ago, I decided to seriously explore an idea that’s been lingering in the back of my mind: opening a teahouse. It all started a few months ago when I visited Tea at Shiloh in downtown LA. The space was breathtaking—calm, intentional, and full of energy that made you want to stay and savor every moment.</description>
