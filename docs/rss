          <description>On Tuesday, I had the pleasure of visiting one of the co-owners of West China Tea House. He welcomed me into his home tea space, which was beautifully set up and radiated warmth. Over tea, he shared his personal journey and stories about sourcing tea in China. He asked me an important question: *What is the ethos of your teahouse?*</description>

          <title>Momentum at -3°C: My First Half Marathon</title>
          <link>https://couchtostartup.com//blog/momentum-consistency</link>
          <description>On January 19th, I finished my first half marathon. It was an unforgettable day—a frigid -3°C (that felt like -11°C with the wind), but I woke up feeling good, dressed up, and ready to go.

          <description>A couple of weeks ago, I reached out to Tea at Shiloh, and to my surprise, one of the owners kindly agreed to speak with me. We talked for over an hour, and they shared so much valuable advice about starting a teahouse. I was incredibly grateful that they took the time to help me.</description>

          <title>The Beginning of Something Beautiful</title>
          <link>https://couchtostartup.com//blog/the-beginning-of-something-beautiful</link>
          <description>A couple of weeks ago, I decided to seriously explore an idea that’s been lingering in the back of my mind: opening a teahouse. It all started a few months ago when I visited Tea at Shiloh in downtown LA. The space was breathtaking—calm, intentional, and full of energy that made you want to stay and savor every moment.</description>
