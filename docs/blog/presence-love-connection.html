He welcomed me into his home tea space, which was beautifully set up and radiated warmth. Over tea, he shared his personal journey and stories about sourcing tea in China. He asked me an important question: <em>What is the ethos of your teahouse?</em></p>
<p>That question made me pause. I realized that I lack a strong, defined vision for my teahouse. For the most part, I&#x27;ve been inspired by the path of Tea at Shiloh. But I know I&#x27;m not anywhere close to where they are, nor should I aim to replicate someone else&#x27;s vision.</p>
<p>What stood out to me is how vision-driven Aurora House is. The owner there has explicitly communicated an ethos of inclusivity, female empowerment, and creating a space for women to thrive. People are drawn to her vision, and they follow her journey because of its <em>authenticity</em>. She&#x27;s building something much bigger—one that she envisions expanding internationally.</p>
<p>So, what is my vision?</p>
<h2 id="presence-love-and-connection"><a href="#presence-love-and-connection" class="anchor"></a>Presence, Love, and Connection</h2>
<p>So far, I&#x27;ve come up with three words: <em>presence</em>, <em>love</em>, and <em>connection</em>. These are ideas I want to guide my teahouse, though they are still evolving.</p>
<h3 id="presence"><a href="#presence" class="anchor"></a>Presence</h3>
<p>To me, this means creating a space where people feel truly grounded and present. I want them to leave their stress and mental clutter outside, like leaving your shoes and ego at the door of a dojo. My teahouse should have a grounding energy that restores presence—a space that feels calming and intentional.</p>
<p>How can the space itself foster presence? I imagine subtle, relaxing music, a soothing fragrance, and calm lighting. The hosts will be more than just servers; they&#x27;ll be beautiful souls who guide the energy and ensure everyone feels welcome and at ease.</p>
<h3 id="love"><a href="#love" class="anchor"></a>Love</h3>
<p>This feels a bit abstract, but I want love to flow throughout the space—love for life, for others, for the world, and for ourselves. The space should nurture a sense of belonging and warmth. <em>I am love. You are love. We are love.</em> That&#x27;s the energy I want the teahouse to radiate.</p>
<h3 id="connection"><a href="#connection" class="anchor"></a>Connection</h3>
<p>Whether guests are chatting or quietly sitting across the room, I want them to feel connected—not just to each other, but to the shared experience of being present in the same space at the same time. There&#x27;s something <em>magical</em> about acknowledging the presence of others and the synchronicity that brought everyone together.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-wellness-mean-to-me"><a href="#what-does-wellness-mean-to-me" class="anchor"></a>What Does Wellness Mean to Me?</h2>
<p>I&#x27;ve been calling this a wellness space, but I&#x27;ve never taken the time to reflect on what wellness actually means to me.</p>
<p>Wellness, to me, is anything that promotes mental and physical well-being. I&#x27;ve been to plenty of wellness events—breathwork, sound baths, saunas, cold plunges—but my definition of wellness feels broader. It&#x27;s about creating a space where people can feel grounded, at peace, and rejuvenated.</p>
<p>When people step into my teahouse, I want them to feel drawn to come back again and again—not just for the tea, but for the <em>meaningful time</em> they get to spend there. It&#x27;s that same feeling I had at Tea at Shiloh, where I immediately knew it was a space I wanted to return to.</p>
<h2 id="evolving-the-vision"><a href="#evolving-the-vision" class="anchor"></a>Evolving the Vision</h2>
<p>I know my vision isn&#x27;t perfect or fully formed yet, but I&#x27;ve accepted that it doesn&#x27;t have to be. Like the space itself, it will continue to grow and evolve. For now, I&#x27;m grateful for the inspiration and guidance I&#x27;ve received from the people I&#x27;ve met. Their stories remind me that I&#x27;m on the right path, even if I&#x27;m still figuring it out.</p>
<p><em>Presence. Love. Connection.</em> These words are my foundation for something great.</p></article><div id="disqus_thread"></div></section><footer class="mb-16"><ul class="font-sm mt-8 flex flex-col space-x-0 space-y-2 text-neutral-600 md:flex-row md:space-x-4 md:space-y-0 dark:text-neutral-300"><li><a class="flex items-center transition-all hover:text-neutral-800 dark:hover:text-neutral-100" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdtlCVbqbMjcTMw23w5Sv5p44Csnz7w85mrAU3w_S_ZmdxUqg/viewform?usp=sharing"><svg width="12" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M2.07102 11.3494L0.963068 10.2415L9.2017 1.98864H2.83807L2.85227 0.454545H11.8438V9.46023H10.2955L10.3097 3.09659L2.07102 11.3494Z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg><p class="ml-2 h-7">subscribe</p></a></li><li><button class="flex items-center transition-all hover:text-neutral-800 dark:hover:text-neutral-100"><svg width="12" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M2.07102 11.3494L0.963068 10.2415L9.2017 1.98864H2.83807L2.85227 0.454545H11.8438V9.46023H10.2955L10.3097 3.09659L2.07102 11.3494Z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg><p class="ml-2 h-7">rss</p></button></li><li><a class="flex items-center transition-all hover:text-neutral-800 dark:hover:text-neutral-100" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/samar.teahouse/"><svg width="12" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M2.07102 11.3494L0.963068 10.2415L9.2017 1.98864H2.83807L2.85227 0.454545H11.8438V9.46023H10.2955L10.3097 3.09659L2.07102 11.3494Z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg><p class="ml-2 h-7">instagram</p></a></li></ul></footer><!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><!--/$--></main><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-022000169f5f400e.js" async=""></script><script>(self.__next_f=self.__next_f||[]).push([0]);self.__next_f.push([2,null])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"1:HL[\"/_next/static/media/ec1a1eae803b668e-s.p.woff2\",\"font\",{\"crossOrigin\":\"\",\"type\":\"font/woff2\"}]\n2:HL[\"/_next/static/media/f980ec13b5b5e554.p.woff2\",\"font\",{\"crossOrigin\":\"\",\"type\":\"font/woff2\"}]\n3:HL[\"/_next/static/css/59e1a6dc3ace7961.css\",\"style\"]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"4:I[2846,[],\"\"]\n7:I[8747,[\"972\",\"static/chunks/972-3d48effdedd8538f.js\",\"979\",\"static/chunks/979-ac9cf2d160ad6d7e.js\",\"308\",\"static/chunks/app/blog/%5Bslug%5D/page-899be63694c0d200.js\"],\"default\"]\n8:I[4707,[],\"\"]\na:I[6423,[],\"\"]\nb:I[8843,[\"972\",\"static/chunks/972-3d48effdedd8538f.js\",\"185\",\"static/chunks/app/layout-b7e698552b49ae37.js\"],\"default\"]\nc:I[2972,[\"972\",\"static/chunks/972-3d48effdedd8538f.js\",\"979\",\"static/chunks/979-ac9cf2d160ad6d7e.js\",\"308\",\"static/chunks/app/blog/%5Bslug%5D/page-899be63694c0d200.js\"],\"\"]\nd:I[7482,[\"972\",\"static/chunks/972-3d48effdedd8538f.js\",\"185\",\"static/chunks/app/layout-b7e698552b49ae37.js\"],\"default\"]\ne:I[8291,[\"972\",\"static/chunks/972-3d48effdedd8538f.js\",\"185\",\"static/chunks/app/layout-b7e698552b49ae37.js\"],\"Analytics\"]\nf:I[5463,[\"972\",\"static/chunks/972-3d48effdedd8538f.js\",\"185\",\"static/chunks/app/layout-b7e698552b49ae37.js\"],\"SpeedInsights\"]\n11:I[1060,[],\"\"]\n9:[\"slug\",\"presence-love-connection\",\"d\"]\n12:[]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"0:[\"$\",\"$L4\",null,{\"buildId\":\"mg0y2yhJEG50Fj7P21cwT\",\"assetPrefix\":\"\",\"urlParts\":[\"\",\"blog\",\"presence-love-connection\"],\"initialTree\":[\"\",{\"children\":[\"blog\",{\"children\":[[\"slug\",\"presence-love-connection\",\"d\"],{\"children\":[\"__PAGE__?{\\\"slug\\\":\\\"presence-love-connection\\\"}\",{}]}]}]},\"$undefined\",\"$undefined\",true],\"initialSeedData\":[\"\",{\"children\":[\"blog\",{\"children\":[[\"slug\",\"presence-love-connection\",\"d\"],{\"children\":[\"__PAGE__\",{},[[\"$L5\",[\"$\",\"section\",null,{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"script\",null,{\"type\":\"application/ld+json\",\"suppressHydrationWarning\":true,\"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\":{\"__html\":\"{\\\"@context\\\":\\\"https://schema.org\\\",\\\"@type\\\":\\\"BlogPosting\\\",\\\"headline\\\":\\\"Presence, Love, and Connection\\\",\\\"datePublished\\\":\\\"2025-01-23T15:54:00Z\\\",\\\"dateModified\\\":\\\"2025-01-23T15:54:00Z\\\",\\\"description\\\":\\\"On Tuesday, I had the pleasure of visiting one of the co-owners of West China Tea House.
