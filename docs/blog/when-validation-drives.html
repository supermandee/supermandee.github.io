I felt <strong>invincible</strong>—using AI-generated code, I built the core functionality in just eight hours and immediately shared it on Medium and LinkedIn. At the time, I believed it had <strong>real</strong> potential, and I couldn’t wait to show everyone.</p>
<p>The <strong>excitement</strong> I felt was <em>physical</em>—an urge expanding like a spider web, ready to reach others.</p>
<p>Eventually, I presented it to my coworkers and one of our directors. One coworker—who leads a major project where my app could play a part—told me <em>it wasn’t the right moment</em> to involve another team. That response threw me off. <em>Why was someone at my level deciding what I could or couldn’t do?</em></p>
<p>The next day, I showed it to her again, this time with a coworker who was one level up. They both agreed it was worth sharing with the leaders managing the larger project.</p>
<p>I also messaged my director, sent him a screenshot of the app, and asked how I could contribute more. <strong>No response.</strong> Self-doubt crept in. <em>What if it’s not as valuable as I thought?</em> But I knew it was—this automation would prevent the burnout that caused two people to quit the last time they did this project manually.</p>
<p>Later, I found out that while he didn’t respond, he did screenshot my message and share it in the managers’ group chat, calling me a <strong>“go-getter.”</strong> That brought some relief.</p>
<p>Soon after, I scheduled a meeting with another director. She was excited about the product, but when I mentioned wanting to take the lead on it, she quickly shifted the conversation. She said they needed to evaluate <em>who should own it</em> because another manager wanted to build a similar tool in Tableau.</p>
<p>The next day, she brought it up in a team meeting, emphasizing that the decision should be based on <strong>roles and responsibilities,</strong> not just personal interest.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but feel like that was directed at me. I had taken the initiative to build something useful, and now corporate bureaucracy was slowing everything down. <em>Maybe I ruffled some feathers by bypassing layers of structure. Maybe I wasn’t supposed to move this quickly.</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, all that initial energy I had—the <strong>spider-web-like expansion</strong>—felt trapped inside me, unable to go anywhere.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="the-bus-driver-and-the-passengers"><a href="#the-bus-driver-and-the-passengers" class="anchor"></a>The Bus Driver and the Passengers</h2>
<p>I talked to my therapist about it. His response?</p>
<p><em>Forget everyone else. You saw an opportunity, took action, and made something happen. That’s success in itself.</em></p>
<p>Then he said something that changed my perspective entirely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“You’re overidentifying with this part of yourself.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At first, I didn’t understand what that meant. He then told me to imagine myself as a <strong>bus driver</strong>, with different versions of me as passengers.</p>
<p>There’s <em>Jealous Me</em>, <em>Coder Me</em>, <em>Entrepreneur Me</em>, <em>Problem-Solving Me</em>, <em>Creative Me</em>—all sitting in the back. The issue is, when one version hijacks the wheel, I become <em>only</em> that person. Right now, <em>Employee Me</em>—the one who wants to create value and gain validation from coworkers and managers—was taking over the bus.</p>
<p>I realized he was right. I was so proud of what I’d built, and the first sign of resistance made me spiral. My emotions were magnified by how closely I tied my identity to this single project. I assumed my coworkers and bosses didn’t value my work when, in reality, <strong>I had no clue what they were thinking.</strong></p>
<p>I remembered that when I started my entrepreneurial journey, I had the same emotional swings—feeling <strong>unstoppable</strong> when things went well and like a <strong>failure</strong> when they didn’t. That’s because back then, <em>Entrepreneur Me</em> was driving the bus. But <strong>I am more than just the work I do.</strong></p>
<p><em>What am I, then?</em> I don’t know. I’m still discovering.</p>
<hr/>
<p>We also talked about my desire for validation—especially from my director, who has always felt intimidating. I wanted him to see me as someone valuable and important. He hired me, and I would not want him to ever feel disappointed. As my therapist explained this, I cried and giggled at the same time. I didn’t even fully understand why I was crying—it just felt like something inside me finally clicked.</p>
<p>I told him I <em>felt sorry for myself</em> for constantly seeking external validation, for caring so much about whether my boss approved of me—which I <em>shouldn’t</em> have.</p>
<p>He paused and then gave me a gift:</p>
<p><em>“Stop saying ‘should’ or ‘shouldn’t.’ That’s just self-shaming. Instead, acknowledge what you’d like to change, without blaming yourself for where you are now. You’re human. You mess up sometimes. No use in shaming yourself.”</em></p>
<p>He pointed out that saying <em>“I shouldn’t care so much about my boss’s opinion”</em> is a form of control we learn as children. A healthier approach would be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I would like to be less affected by other people’s validation.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he reminded me: <strong>I am worthy as I am.</strong></p>
<p>My value isn’t just in my work—it’s in my <strong>kindness</strong>, my <strong>ability to share</strong>, my <strong>intentions</strong>. It’s in the spaces I create, like my <strong>Love Letter Tea Social</strong>, where I helped foster an environment of warmth and expression.</p>
<p><strong>My worth isn’t measured by a promotion, a title, or an approval from a boss.</strong></p>
<p>It’s measured by the value I bring to the world in <em>all</em> its forms.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="rewriting-my-script"><a href="#rewriting-my-script" class="anchor"></a>Rewriting My Script</h2>
<p>He told me that much of this comes from <strong>cultural conditioning</strong>—the way I was raised, past experiences, and learned behaviors. In Eastern cultures, <em>performance is often directly tied to identity and worth.</em> For most of my life, I internalized that belief. My success, my productivity, my ability to impress authority figures—these became measures of my value.</p>
<p>But <strong>I don’t have to keep following that script.</strong></p>
<p>I can <em>rewrite</em> it.</p>
<p>Not by throwing the whole book out the window, but by making <strong>small, intentional changes</strong>—choosing what truly matters to me and defining success on my own terms.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="the-more-acceptance-i-find-in-myself"><a href="#the-more-acceptance-i-find-in-myself" class="anchor"></a>The More Acceptance I Find in Myself…</h2>
<p>By the end of our session, I felt <strong>relieved. Understood.</strong> I left with a deeper awareness of <em>why</em> I react the way I do and how I can start changing it.</p>
<p>A few hours later, my therapist sent me a message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“The more acceptance you find in yourself, the less you will seek in others.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that’s where I’ll start.</p></article><div id="disqus_thread"></div></section><footer class="mb-16"><ul class="font-sm mt-8 flex flex-col space-x-0 space-y-2 text-neutral-600 md:flex-row md:space-x-4 md:space-y-0 dark:text-neutral-300"><li><a class="flex items-center transition-all hover:text-neutral-800 dark:hover:text-neutral-100" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdtlCVbqbMjcTMw23w5Sv5p44Csnz7w85mrAU3w_S_ZmdxUqg/viewform?usp=sharing"><svg width="12" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M2.07102 11.3494L0.963068 10.2415L9.2017 1.98864H2.83807L2.85227 0.454545H11.8438V9.46023H10.2955L10.3097 3.09659L2.07102 11.3494Z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg><p class="ml-2 h-7">subscribe</p></a></li><li><button class="flex items-center transition-all hover:text-neutral-800 dark:hover:text-neutral-100"><svg width="12" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M2.07102 11.3494L0.963068 10.2415L9.2017 1.98864H2.83807L2.85227 0.454545H11.8438V9.46023H10.2955L10.3097 3.09659L2.07102 11.3494Z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg><p class="ml-2 h-7">rss</p></button></li><li><a class="flex items-center transition-all hover:text-neutral-800 dark:hover:text-neutral-100" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/samar.teahouse/"><svg width="12" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M2.07102 11.3494L0.963068 10.2415L9.2017 1.98864H2.83807L2.85227 0.454545H11.8438V9.46023H10.2955L10.3097 3.09659L2.07102 11.3494Z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg><p class="ml-2 h-7">instagram</p></a></li></ul></footer><!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><!--/$--></main><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-022000169f5f400e.js" async=""></script><script>(self.__next_f=self.__next_f||[]).push([0]);self.__next_f.push([2,null])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"1:HL[\"/_next/static/media/ec1a1eae803b668e-s.p.woff2\",\"font\",{\"crossOrigin\":\"\",\"type\":\"font/woff2\"}]\n2:HL[\"/_next/static/media/f980ec13b5b5e554.p.woff2\",\"font\",{\"crossOrigin\":\"\",\"type\":\"font/woff2\"}]\n3:HL[\"/_next/static/css/195d1271395b5c4f.css\",\"style\"]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"4:I[2846,[],\"\"]\n7:I[8747,[\"972\",\"static/chunks/972-3d48effdedd8538f.js\",\"979\",\"static/chunks/979-ac9cf2d160ad6d7e.js\",\"308\",\"static/chunks/app/blog/%5Bslug%5D/page-899be63694c0d200.js\"],\"default\"]\n8:I[4707,[],\"\"]\na:I[6423,[],\"\"]\nb:I[8843,[\"972\",\"static/chunks/972-3d48effdedd8538f.js\",\"185\",\"static/chunks/app/layout-b7e698552b49ae37.js\"],\"default\"]\nc:I[2972,[\"972\",\"static/chunks/972-3d48effdedd8538f.js\",\"979\",\"static/chunks/979-ac9cf2d160ad6d7e.js\",\"308\",\"static/chunks/app/blog/%5Bslug%5D/page-899be63694c0d200.js\"],\"\"]\nd:I[7482,[\"972\",\"static/chunks/972-3d48effdedd8538f.js\",\"185\",\"static/chunks/app/layout-b7e698552b49ae37.js\"],\"default\"]\ne:I[8291,[\"972\",\"static/chunks/972-3d48effdedd8538f.js\",\"185\",\"static/chunks/app/layout-b7e698552b49ae37.js\"],\"Analytics\"]\nf:I[5463,[\"972\",\"static/chunks/972-3d48effdedd8538f.js\",\"185\",\"static/chunks/app/layout-b7e698552b49ae37.js\"],\"SpeedInsights\"]\n11:I[1060,[],\"\"]\n9:[\"slug\",\"when-validation-drives\",\"d\"]\n12:[]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"0:[\"$\",\"$L4\",null,{\"buildId\":\"NQHXl8xCZeWLl_Pxgw23_\",\"assetPrefix\":\"\",\"urlParts\":[\"\",\"blog\",\"when-validation-drives\"],\"initialTree\":[\"\",{\"children\":[\"blog\",{\"children\":[[\"slug\",\"when-validation-drives\",\"d\"],{\"children\":[\"__PAGE__?{\\\"slug\\\":\\\"when-validation-drives\\\"}\",{}]}]}]},\"$undefined\",\"$undefined\",true],\"initialSeedData\":[\"\",{\"children\":[\"blog\",{\"children\":[[\"slug\",\"when-validation-drives\",\"d\"],{\"children\":[\"__PAGE__\",{},[[\"$L5\",[\"$\",\"section\",null,{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"script\",null,{\"type\":\"application/ld+json\",\"suppressHydrationWarning\":true,\"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\":{\"__html\":\"{\\\"@context\\\":\\\"https://schema.org\\\",\\\"@type\\\":\\\"BlogPosting\\\",\\\"headline\\\":\\\"When Validation Drives the Bus\\\",\\\"datePublished\\\":\\\"2025-02-15\\\",\\\"dateModified\\\":\\\"2025-02-15\\\",\\\"description\\\":\\\"In my last journal, I talked about the *project that energized me at work.* I found an opportunity to automate a tedious process, jumped on it, and built something I thought would be valuable for our teams.
