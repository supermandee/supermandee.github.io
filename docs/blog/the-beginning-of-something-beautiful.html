It all started a few months ago when I visited <strong>Tea at Shiloh</strong> in downtown LA. The space was breathtaking—calm, intentional, and full of energy that made you want to stay and savor every moment.</p>
<p>I remember thinking, <em>Why isn’t there a place like this in Austin?</em> The vibe, the aesthetic—everything about it screamed Austin to me. My friend who introduced me to the space even suggested reaching out to Tea at Shiloh about a potential franchising opportunity.</p>
<p>For months, I waited to act on this idea. The reason? <strong>My visa situation.</strong> As an international student-turned-professional, I’ve spent years navigating the constraints of staying in the U.S. After graduating, I relied on my OPT, which is set to expire on <strong>June 30, 2025</strong>. I didn’t get an H-1B visa, and for a long time, I honestly didn’t know if I would even be able to stay in the U.S. much longer. My career decisions were driven more by practicality than passion.</p>
<p>When I chose marketing for my master’s degree, it wasn’t because I loved it—it was the next logical step from my film background, and it granted me a STEM degree that extended my visa eligibility. To secure my future, I pivoted to data science, spending countless hours studying and upskilling. Eventually, I landed a role as a <strong>marketing data scientist</strong>—a title I was proud of at the time.</p>
<p>I thought having a “cool” job at a “cool” company would make me feel accomplished, even fulfilled. And for a while, it did. I loved telling people what I did and basked in the recognition it brought. But as time went on, that sense of pride wore off.</p>
<p>Two years into the job, I realized I wasn’t happy. The constant changes at the company, the lack of growth opportunities, and most importantly, my own disinterest in the work left me feeling empty. I blame myself, too—I never advocated for more because, deep down, I didn’t care about the work.</p>
<p>For so long, I felt stuck in this cycle: <em>I don’t like my job; I want a new job.</em> But every time I considered making a change, my negative thoughts would hold me back: <em>I’m not good enough. I’ll fail the coding exams. I’m a fake data scientist.</em> These doubts kept me paralyzed, and I stayed where I was, too unmotivated to push myself toward something new.</p>
<p>In search of meaning, I poured myself into hobbies: <strong>triathlon training, freediving, traveling, music festivals,</strong> and more. But no matter how much joy these brought, they couldn’t fill the void of spending eight hours a day doing something that felt meaningless. I didn’t want to dedicate my time to helping a corporation make more money, especially when it didn’t align with my values.</p>
<p>Then came <strong>December 2024</strong>, and everything changed. My parents decided to support me in applying for an <strong>EB-5 investment visa</strong>, a move that would give me the freedom to work in the U.S. on my terms. For the first time in years, I wasn’t bound by a job for survival. I could finally do something that speaks true to me.</p>
<p>That’s when I realized: <strong>this is my chance.</strong> The teahouse idea that had been quietly waiting in the back of my mind suddenly felt possible. I could create something beautiful, just like Tea at Shiloh, but make it my own. Something that brings people together, fosters a sense of peace, and fills the void I’ve felt for so long.</p>
<hr/>
<p>And so, here I am, documenting the beginning of this journey. I don’t know where it will lead or what obstacles I’ll face, but I know one thing: it’s time to take a leap of faith, step out of my comfort zone, and create something meaningful.</p></article><div id="disqus_thread"></div></section><footer class="mb-16"><ul class="font-sm mt-8 flex flex-col space-x-0 space-y-2 text-neutral-600 md:flex-row md:space-x-4 md:space-y-0 dark:text-neutral-300"><li><a class="flex items-center transition-all hover:text-neutral-800 dark:hover:text-neutral-100" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdtlCVbqbMjcTMw23w5Sv5p44Csnz7w85mrAU3w_S_ZmdxUqg/viewform?usp=sharing"><svg width="12" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M2.07102 11.3494L0.963068 10.2415L9.2017 1.98864H2.83807L2.85227 0.454545H11.8438V9.46023H10.2955L10.3097 3.09659L2.07102 11.3494Z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg><p class="ml-2 h-7">subscribe</p></a></li><li><button class="flex items-center transition-all hover:text-neutral-800 dark:hover:text-neutral-100"><svg width="12" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M2.07102 11.3494L0.963068 10.2415L9.2017 1.98864H2.83807L2.85227 0.454545H11.8438V9.46023H10.2955L10.3097 3.09659L2.07102 11.3494Z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg><p class="ml-2 h-7">rss</p></button></li><li><a class="flex items-center transition-all hover:text-neutral-800 dark:hover:text-neutral-100" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/samar.teahouse/"><svg width="12" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M2.07102 11.3494L0.963068 10.2415L9.2017 1.98864H2.83807L2.85227 0.454545H11.8438V9.46023H10.2955L10.3097 3.09659L2.07102 11.3494Z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg><p class="ml-2 h-7">instagram</p></a></li></ul></footer><!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><!--/$--></main><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-022000169f5f400e.js" async=""></script><script>(self.__next_f=self.__next_f||[]).push([0]);self.__next_f.push([2,null])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"1:HL[\"/_next/static/media/ec1a1eae803b668e-s.p.woff2\",\"font\",{\"crossOrigin\":\"\",\"type\":\"font/woff2\"}]\n2:HL[\"/_next/static/media/f980ec13b5b5e554.p.woff2\",\"font\",{\"crossOrigin\":\"\",\"type\":\"font/woff2\"}]\n3:HL[\"/_next/static/css/8d4ee040dd1d5859.css\",\"style\"]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"4:I[2846,[],\"\"]\n7:I[8747,[\"972\",\"static/chunks/972-3d48effdedd8538f.js\",\"979\",\"static/chunks/979-ac9cf2d160ad6d7e.js\",\"308\",\"static/chunks/app/blog/%5Bslug%5D/page-899be63694c0d200.js\"],\"default\"]\n8:I[4707,[],\"\"]\na:I[6423,[],\"\"]\nb:I[8843,[\"972\",\"static/chunks/972-3d48effdedd8538f.js\",\"185\",\"static/chunks/app/layout-aab297a4b6ae2dc1.js\"],\"default\"]\nc:I[2972,[\"972\",\"static/chunks/972-3d48effdedd8538f.js\",\"979\",\"static/chunks/979-ac9cf2d160ad6d7e.js\",\"308\",\"static/chunks/app/blog/%5Bslug%5D/page-899be63694c0d200.js\"],\"\"]\nd:I[7482,[\"972\",\"static/chunks/972-3d48effdedd8538f.js\",\"185\",\"static/chunks/app/layout-aab297a4b6ae2dc1.js\"],\"default\"]\ne:I[8291,[\"972\",\"static/chunks/972-3d48effdedd8538f.js\",\"185\",\"static/chunks/app/layout-aab297a4b6ae2dc1.js\"],\"Analytics\"]\nf:I[5463,[\"972\",\"static/chunks/972-3d48effdedd8538f.js\",\"185\",\"static/chunks/app/layout-aab297a4b6ae2dc1.js\"],\"SpeedInsights\"]\n11:I[1060,[],\"\"]\n9:[\"slug\",\"the-beginning-of-something-beautiful\",\"d\"]\n12:[]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"0:[\"$\",\"$L4\",null,{\"buildId\":\"_EXcyB4ifj_Omv8BxbEpr\",\"assetPrefix\":\"\",\"urlParts\":[\"\",\"blog\",\"the-beginning-of-something-beautiful\"],\"initialTree\":[\"\",{\"children\":[\"blog\",{\"children\":[[\"slug\",\"the-beginning-of-something-beautiful\",\"d\"],{\"children\":[\"__PAGE__?{\\\"slug\\\":\\\"the-beginning-of-something-beautiful\\\"}\",{}]}]}]},\"$undefined\",\"$undefined\",true],\"initialSeedData\":[\"\",{\"children\":[\"blog\",{\"children\":[[\"slug\",\"the-beginning-of-something-beautiful\",\"d\"],{\"children\":[\"__PAGE__\",{},[[\"$L5\",[\"$\",\"section\",null,{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"script\",null,{\"type\":\"application/ld+json\",\"suppressHydrationWarning\":true,\"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\":{\"__html\":\"{\\\"@context\\\":\\\"https://schema.org\\\",\\\"@type\\\":\\\"BlogPosting\\\",\\\"headline\\\":\\\"The Beginning of Something Beautiful\\\",\\\"datePublished\\\":\\\"2025-01-17\\\",\\\"dateModified\\\":\\\"2025-01-17\\\",\\\"description\\\":\\\"A couple of weeks ago, I decided to seriously explore an idea that’s been lingering in the back of my mind: opening a teahouse.
