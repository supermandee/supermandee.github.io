It wasn’t that I had a <em>deep-seated desire</em> to change my role; rather, the shift was inspired by how our team was evolving—we were starting to build more products, and I had a manager who supported that transition. My motivation was driven by the <strong>momentum</strong> around me, not by an intrinsic passion for the title of &quot;product manager.&quot;</p>
<p>However, a recent conversation with a coworker about the next steps in my career sparked a period of deep reflection. I began to reassess my journey and discovered that, while many describe corporate life as a <em>soul-sucking 9-to-5</em>, my own experience has been more nuanced. Sure, I’ve witnessed the typical downsides—office politics and tasks that sometimes feel meaningless—but my role has also provided me with remarkable flexibility and the freedom to pursue projects that truly excite me.</p>
<p>After a recent reorganization left me feeling directionless, I stumbled upon a project opportunity that shifted my perspective. I identified a challenge that cost teams countless hours of manual work in Excel and PowerPoint. Determined to find a better way, I built an MVP in under eight hours using AI—a fully automated React app that transformed tedious work into an efficient, streamlined process.</p>
<p>That project did more than just eliminate repetitive tasks; it reignited my passion for <em>problem-solving</em>. Seeing how crucial the data was for our brand positioning—and knowing that colleagues had left due to the frustrations they experienced—I realized that the tool I had built has the potential to create <strong>genuine business value</strong>.</p>
<p>Immersing myself in learning React, with AI as my coding partner, I experienced a <em>burst of energy and creativity</em>. In that moment, I wasn’t burdened by the frustrations of my job; I was exhilarated and inspired. It reminded me of my previous personal project with Spotify and OpenAI, which had shown me what I was capable of and empowered me to seize opportunities when they knocked.</p>
<p>Ultimately, what drives me is the desire to create <strong>meaningful impact</strong>—whether that’s through a product, an automation tool, or a machine learning model. I now understand that the concept of &quot;product&quot; is just one format among many. What truly matters to me is the opportunity to <strong>build, innovate, and deliver value</strong>. If I end up in a product management role, that’s a bonus, but the title itself is secondary to the impact I can create.</p>
<p>Reflecting on these experiences, I see that my entrepreneurial ambitions aren’t a rejection of corporate life. In fact, I’ve been fortunate to work in an environment that values <em>autonomy and creativity</em>. The project I built reaffirmed that having the freedom to explore my ideas—and knowing that each endeavor creates real value—leaves me both <em>passionate and energized</em>.</p>
<p>So why start a startup? For me, it’s about healing from past setbacks, forging genuine connections with people, and proving to myself that I can take full ownership of something truly meaningful. Today, I’m opening my eyes—and my heart—to new opportunities, embracing this period of change, and committing to a journey where the real measure of success is the value I create along the way.</p></article><div id="disqus_thread"></div></section><footer class="mb-16"><ul class="font-sm mt-8 flex flex-col space-x-0 space-y-2 text-neutral-600 md:flex-row md:space-x-4 md:space-y-0 dark:text-neutral-300"><li><a class="flex items-center transition-all hover:text-neutral-800 dark:hover:text-neutral-100" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdtlCVbqbMjcTMw23w5Sv5p44Csnz7w85mrAU3w_S_ZmdxUqg/viewform?usp=sharing"><svg width="12" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M2.07102 11.3494L0.963068 10.2415L9.2017 1.98864H2.83807L2.85227 0.454545H11.8438V9.46023H10.2955L10.3097 3.09659L2.07102 11.3494Z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg><p class="ml-2 h-7">subscribe</p></a></li><li><button class="flex items-center transition-all hover:text-neutral-800 dark:hover:text-neutral-100"><svg width="12" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M2.07102 11.3494L0.963068 10.2415L9.2017 1.98864H2.83807L2.85227 0.454545H11.8438V9.46023H10.2955L10.3097 3.09659L2.07102 11.3494Z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg><p class="ml-2 h-7">rss</p></button></li><li><a class="flex items-center transition-all hover:text-neutral-800 dark:hover:text-neutral-100" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/samar.teahouse/"><svg width="12" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M2.07102 11.3494L0.963068 10.2415L9.2017 1.98864H2.83807L2.85227 0.454545H11.8438V9.46023H10.2955L10.3097 3.09659L2.07102 11.3494Z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg><p class="ml-2 h-7">instagram</p></a></li></ul></footer><!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><!--/$--></main><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-022000169f5f400e.js" async=""></script><script>(self.__next_f=self.__next_f||[]).push([0]);self.__next_f.push([2,null])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"1:HL[\"/_next/static/media/ec1a1eae803b668e-s.p.woff2\",\"font\",{\"crossOrigin\":\"\",\"type\":\"font/woff2\"}]\n2:HL[\"/_next/static/media/f980ec13b5b5e554.p.woff2\",\"font\",{\"crossOrigin\":\"\",\"type\":\"font/woff2\"}]\n3:HL[\"/_next/static/css/195d1271395b5c4f.css\",\"style\"]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"4:I[2846,[],\"\"]\n7:I[8747,[\"972\",\"static/chunks/972-3d48effdedd8538f.js\",\"979\",\"static/chunks/979-ac9cf2d160ad6d7e.js\",\"308\",\"static/chunks/app/blog/%5Bslug%5D/page-899be63694c0d200.js\"],\"default\"]\n8:I[4707,[],\"\"]\na:I[6423,[],\"\"]\nb:I[8843,[\"972\",\"static/chunks/972-3d48effdedd8538f.js\",\"185\",\"static/chunks/app/layout-b7e698552b49ae37.js\"],\"default\"]\nc:I[2972,[\"972\",\"static/chunks/972-3d48effdedd8538f.js\",\"979\",\"static/chunks/979-ac9cf2d160ad6d7e.js\",\"308\",\"static/chunks/app/blog/%5Bslug%5D/page-899be63694c0d200.js\"],\"\"]\nd:I[7482,[\"972\",\"static/chunks/972-3d48effdedd8538f.js\",\"185\",\"static/chunks/app/layout-b7e698552b49ae37.js\"],\"default\"]\ne:I[8291,[\"972\",\"static/chunks/972-3d48effdedd8538f.js\",\"185\",\"static/chunks/app/layout-b7e698552b49ae37.js\"],\"Analytics\"]\nf:I[5463,[\"972\",\"static/chunks/972-3d48effdedd8538f.js\",\"185\",\"static/chunks/app/layout-b7e698552b49ae37.js\"],\"SpeedInsights\"]\n11:I[1060,[],\"\"]\n9:[\"slug\",\"uncovering-my-why\",\"d\"]\n12:[]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"0:[\"$\",\"$L4\",null,{\"buildId\":\"1Rjq9dTUx_6sOS46C_BxW\",\"assetPrefix\":\"\",\"urlParts\":[\"\",\"blog\",\"uncovering-my-why\"],\"initialTree\":[\"\",{\"children\":[\"blog\",{\"children\":[[\"slug\",\"uncovering-my-why\",\"d\"],{\"children\":[\"__PAGE__?{\\\"slug\\\":\\\"uncovering-my-why\\\"}\",{}]}]}]},\"$undefined\",\"$undefined\",true],\"initialSeedData\":[\"\",{\"children\":[\"blog\",{\"children\":[[\"slug\",\"uncovering-my-why\",\"d\"],{\"children\":[\"__PAGE__\",{},[[\"$L5\",[\"$\",\"section\",null,{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"script\",null,{\"type\":\"application/ld+json\",\"suppressHydrationWarning\":true,\"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\":{\"__html\":\"{\\\"@context\\\":\\\"https://schema.org\\\",\\\"@type\\\":\\\"BlogPosting\\\",\\\"headline\\\":\\\"Beyond the 9-to-5: Uncovering My Deeper Why\\\",\\\"datePublished\\\":\\\"2025-02-09\\\",\\\"dateModified\\\":\\\"2025-02-09\\\",\\\"description\\\":\\\"Last year, I found myself considering a move from data science to product management.
