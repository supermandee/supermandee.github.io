We talked for over an hour, and they shared so much valuable advice about starting a teahouse. I was incredibly grateful that they took the time to help me.</p>
<p>After that conversation, I started planning my timeline and drafting a business plan with estimated costs. Admittedly, everything felt fuzzy—I had no clear idea how much it would actually cost. But I did my best to research. I looked up the costs of licenses, rent for a space, utilities, and everything else I could think of. I also reached out to <strong>Chinese designers</strong> to explore more affordable design services and materials, and even furniture from China.</p>
<p>I connected with a modern Chinese tea company that specializes in branding and sourcing for contemporary tea shops. They provided insight into resources and supply chains, which helped me start piecing things together. However, <strong>funding quickly emerged as my biggest obstacle.</strong> I learned that SBA loans require at least two years of business experience, which I don’t have. That leaves me relying on my personal savings and possibly investments from friends.</p>
<p>Even with those options, raising $200,000—or more—felt like an impossible goal. When I spoke with the owner at Tea at Shiloh again, they told me that with such limited funding, I’d need a lot of help from others. That hit a nerve. Growing up, I’ve always preferred to do things on my own. I’ve struggled to trust others to handle things better than I could. In college group projects, for instance, I would often take charge and do everything myself. The idea of relying on people and networking makes me deeply uncomfortable. It also brought out a deeper insecurity I’ve carried for years—<strong>my fear of rejection and the uncertainty of connecting with new people.</strong></p>
<p>But through these conversations, I’ve realized something profound: <strong>business owners are magnets for resources and connections.</strong> Entrepreneurship will be an incredible opportunity for me to grow into the person I’ve always wanted to be—a version of myself that is courageous, authentic, and open.</p>
<hr/>
<p>That conversation also revealed a hard truth: I can’t just throw money at a space and expect people to show up. The Tea at Shiloh team did a ton of groundwork before they even opened. They had trial runs, built anticipation, and created a community around their brand. When they launched, it wasn’t just a teahouse opening—it was something that people had been waiting for. I don’t have that kind of community or those marketing skills, and the reality of that left me feeling crushed.</p>
<p>For a moment, I felt like my dreams were shattered. I kept thinking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I have no talent. I have no money. What am I even good at?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there’s one thing I can confidently say I’m good at, it’s <strong>organizing and planning.</strong> My mind immediately starts thinking of all the details: what equipment is needed, what steps need to happen, and how to keep everything on track.</p>
<p>My boyfriend reminded me of something I’d once said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Do you know who goes on stage to accept the Oscar when a film wins Best Picture? The producer. The behind-the-scenes person no one hears about.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe that’s the role I’m meant to play—the producer who brings the vision to life. But to do that, I might need to find my “director,” someone who can create the energy and excitement I want for the space.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The next day, I had a meeting with the owner of <strong>Aurora House</strong>, an arts and crafts space focused on female empowerment. They’ve already achieved incredible success, and I was lucky that she scheduled time to talk with me. During our meeting, I learned that she didn’t spend half a million dollars to start her business. In fact, her current space is just a trial run for a much bigger vision. Her journey, from tech to running a creative space with a powerful mission, left me feeling deeply inspired. She showed me that you don’t need a fortune to get started. Sometimes, you just need a clear vision, determination, and a bit of help along the way.</p>
<p>So far, everyone I’ve spoken with has been incredibly supportive, and I’m so grateful for the connections I’m making. I’ve realized that I need to take a leap of faith and make the changes I want to see in my life. As they say, <em>nothing changes if nothing changes.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>Right now, I’m focusing on <strong>meeting people and learning from them.</strong> I’ve started reaching out to business owners, wellness event organizers, and anyone else who can share their experience. Next week, I’m hosting my first <strong>tea social</strong>—a cozy gathering in my apartment with tea and s’mores. We’ll see how it goes.</p>
<p><strong>Until next time…</strong></p></article><div id="disqus_thread"></div></section><footer class="mb-16"><ul class="font-sm mt-8 flex flex-col space-x-0 space-y-2 text-neutral-600 md:flex-row md:space-x-4 md:space-y-0 dark:text-neutral-300"><li><a class="flex items-center transition-all hover:text-neutral-800 dark:hover:text-neutral-100" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdtlCVbqbMjcTMw23w5Sv5p44Csnz7w85mrAU3w_S_ZmdxUqg/viewform?usp=sharing"><svg width="12" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M2.07102 11.3494L0.963068 10.2415L9.2017 1.98864H2.83807L2.85227 0.454545H11.8438V9.46023H10.2955L10.3097 3.09659L2.07102 11.3494Z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg><p class="ml-2 h-7">subscribe</p></a></li><li><button class="flex items-center transition-all hover:text-neutral-800 dark:hover:text-neutral-100"><svg width="12" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M2.07102 11.3494L0.963068 10.2415L9.2017 1.98864H2.83807L2.85227 0.454545H11.8438V9.46023H10.2955L10.3097 3.09659L2.07102 11.3494Z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg><p class="ml-2 h-7">rss</p></button></li><li><a class="flex items-center transition-all hover:text-neutral-800 dark:hover:text-neutral-100" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/samar.teahouse/"><svg width="12" height="12" viewBox="0 0 12 12" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M2.07102 11.3494L0.963068 10.2415L9.2017 1.98864H2.83807L2.85227 0.454545H11.8438V9.46023H10.2955L10.3097 3.09659L2.07102 11.3494Z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg><p class="ml-2 h-7">instagram</p></a></li></ul></footer><!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><!--/$--></main><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-022000169f5f400e.js" async=""></script><script>(self.__next_f=self.__next_f||[]).push([0]);self.__next_f.push([2,null])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"1:HL[\"/_next/static/media/ec1a1eae803b668e-s.p.woff2\",\"font\",{\"crossOrigin\":\"\",\"type\":\"font/woff2\"}]\n2:HL[\"/_next/static/media/f980ec13b5b5e554.p.woff2\",\"font\",{\"crossOrigin\":\"\",\"type\":\"font/woff2\"}]\n3:HL[\"/_next/static/css/59e1a6dc3ace7961.css\",\"style\"]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"4:I[2846,[],\"\"]\n7:I[8747,[\"972\",\"static/chunks/972-3d48effdedd8538f.js\",\"979\",\"static/chunks/979-ac9cf2d160ad6d7e.js\",\"308\",\"static/chunks/app/blog/%5Bslug%5D/page-899be63694c0d200.js\"],\"default\"]\n8:I[4707,[],\"\"]\na:I[6423,[],\"\"]\nb:I[8843,[\"972\",\"static/chunks/972-3d48effdedd8538f.js\",\"185\",\"static/chunks/app/layout-b7e698552b49ae37.js\"],\"default\"]\nc:I[2972,[\"972\",\"static/chunks/972-3d48effdedd8538f.js\",\"979\",\"static/chunks/979-ac9cf2d160ad6d7e.js\",\"308\",\"static/chunks/app/blog/%5Bslug%5D/page-899be63694c0d200.js\"],\"\"]\nd:I[7482,[\"972\",\"static/chunks/972-3d48effdedd8538f.js\",\"185\",\"static/chunks/app/layout-b7e698552b49ae37.js\"],\"default\"]\ne:I[8291,[\"972\",\"static/chunks/972-3d48effdedd8538f.js\",\"185\",\"static/chunks/app/layout-b7e698552b49ae37.js\"],\"Analytics\"]\nf:I[5463,[\"972\",\"static/chunks/972-3d48effdedd8538f.js\",\"185\",\"static/chunks/app/layout-b7e698552b49ae37.js\"],\"SpeedInsights\"]\n11:I[1060,[],\"\"]\n9:[\"slug\",\"lessons-from-conversations\",\"d\"]\n12:[]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"0:[\"$\",\"$L4\",null,{\"buildId\":\"7Jn6z4EHOOfC7Oyeb8iCh\",\"assetPrefix\":\"\",\"urlParts\":[\"\",\"blog\",\"lessons-from-conversations\"],\"initialTree\":[\"\",{\"children\":[\"blog\",{\"children\":[[\"slug\",\"lessons-from-conversations\",\"d\"],{\"children\":[\"__PAGE__?{\\\"slug\\\":\\\"lessons-from-conversations\\\"}\",{}]}]}]},\"$undefined\",\"$undefined\",true],\"initialSeedData\":[\"\",{\"children\":[\"blog\",{\"children\":[[\"slug\",\"lessons-from-conversations\",\"d\"],{\"children\":[\"__PAGE__\",{},[[\"$L5\",[\"$\",\"section\",null,{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"script\",null,{\"type\":\"application/ld+json\",\"suppressHydrationWarning\":true,\"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\":{\"__html\":\"{\\\"@context\\\":\\\"https://schema.org\\\",\\\"@type\\\":\\\"BlogPosting\\\",\\\"headline\\\":\\\"Lessons from Conversations\\\",\\\"datePublished\\\":\\\"2025-01-17\\\",\\\"dateModified\\\":\\\"2025-01-17\\\",\\\"description\\\":\\\"A couple of weeks ago, I reached out to Tea at Shiloh, and to my surprise, one of the owners kindly agreed to speak with me.
